          <li>By purchasing subscription to the Content via the App, you will pay the app store from which you have
            downloaded the App (the “App Store”) the applicable fees (and any related taxes) disclosed to you through
            the App as they become due.</li>
          <li>SUBSCRIPTION AUTOMATICALLY RENEWS. YOU MUST AFFIRMATIVELY CANCEL A SUBSCRIPTION OR A FREE TRIAL TO AVOID
            BEING CHARGED IN YOUR APP STORE’S ACCOUNT SETTINGS AT LEAST 24 HOURS BEFORE THE END OF THE FREE TRIAL OR THE
            CURRENT SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD.
          </li>
          <li>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable laws, we may change subscription fees at any time. We will
            give you a reasonable notice of any such pricing changes by posting the new prices on or through the App
            and/or by sending you an email notification. If you do not wish to pay the new fees, you can cancel the
            applicable subscription prior to the change going into effect.</li>
          <li>By signing up for certain subscriptions, you agree that your subscription may be automatically renewed.
            Unless you cancel your subscription, you authorize the App Store(s) to charge you for the renewal term. The
            period of auto-renewal will be the same as your initial subscription period unless otherwise disclosed to
            you through the App. The renewal rate will be no more than the rate for the immediately prior subscription
            period, excluding any promotional and discount pricing, unless we notify you of a rate change prior to your
            auto-renewal. You must cancel your subscription in accordance with the cancellation procedures disclosed to

            not prorate fees for a cancelled subscription.</li>
          <li>We may offer a free trial subscription for the Service. Free trial provides you with access to the Service
            for a period of time, with details specified when you sign up for the offer. Unless you cancel before the
            end of the free trial, or unless otherwise stated, your access to the Service will automatically continue
            and you will be billed the applicable fees for the Service. We may send you a reminder when your free trial
            is about to end, but we do not guarantee any such notifications. It is ultimately your responsibility to
            know when the free trial will end. We reserve the right, in our absolute discretion, to modify or terminate
            any free trial offer, your access to the Service during the free trial, or any of these terms without notice
            and with no liability. We reserve the right to limit your ability to take advantage of multiple free trials.

          <li>IN ADDITION TO PURCHASING SUBSCRIPTIONS, YOU MAY BE OFFERED <b>ADD-ON ITEMS FOR AN ADDITIONAL FEE</b>.
            This purchase is optional: your subscription is not conditional on such purchase. If you choose to purchase
            any add-on items, you will be immediately charged the relevant fee indicated on the purchase screen. In
            contrast to subscriptions, add-on items are one-off lifetime purchase that is final and cannot be cancelled.

          We disclaim any implied or statutory warranties regarding:
        </p>
        <ul class="dot-bull">
          <li>the security, accuracy, reliability, timeliness and performance of the Service; or</li>
          <li>the performance of or accuracy, quality, currency, completeness or usefulness of any information provided
            by the Service; or</li>
          <li>that the Service will be error-free or that any errors will be corrected.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We do not warrant that any description provided through the Service regarding healthcare or otherwise is
          accurate, complete, reliable, current, safe or error-free. No communication, information or advice given by us
          or any representative of ours, whether written or oral, shall create any warranty. If you choose to rely on
          such information, you do so solely at your own risk. Some states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion
          of certain warranties. Accordingly, some of the above exclusions may not apply to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Service may not be available in all languages or in all countries, and we make no representation that the

          This disclaimer constitutes an essential part of these Terms of Use.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>Limitation of liability</h2>
        <p>
          To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, under no circumstances and under no legal or equitable
          theory, whether in tort, contract, strict liability or otherwise, shall we, our affiliates, or any of our or
          their employees, directors, officers, agents, vendors or suppliers be liable to you or to any third party for
          any personal injury, including death, or for any indirect, special, incidental or consequential losses or
          damages of any nature arising out of or in connection with the use of or inability to use the Service,
          including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, loss of data, work stoppage,
          accuracy of results, or Device failure or malfunction, even if a representative of ours has been advised of or
          should have known of the possibility of such damages. In no event will we be liable for any damages in excess
          of fifty US dollars ($50).
        </p>
        <p>
          Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of
          liability for certain damages. Accordingly, some of the above limitations and disclaimers may not apply to
          you. To the extent that we may not, as a matter of applicable law, disclaim any implied warranty or limit
          liabilities, the scope and duration of such warranty and the extent of our liability will be the minimum
          permitted under such applicable law.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any claims arising in connection with your use of the Service must be brought within one (1) year of the date

          limited to those expressly provided for in these Terms of Use, even if the applicable remedy under these Terms
          of Use fails of its essential purpose.
